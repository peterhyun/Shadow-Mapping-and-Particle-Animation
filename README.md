# Shadow-Mapping-and-Particle-Animation
UBC CPSC 314-Computer Graphics Final Assignment: Implementing Shadow Mapping, Normal Mapping, and Environmental Mapping + Creative License.

Opening the html file with Firefox instead of Chrome would be highly recommended.

I used three.js for WebGL programming.

Part1 is where the basic environment mapping and shadows take place.
Part2 is where I add rain effects/lightning effects/sound to the given scene.
Enjoy!
